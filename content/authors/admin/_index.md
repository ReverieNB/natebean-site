I'm a Research Associate at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs and created this site to use data analysis to explore my interests and practice my R skills. I plan to post about the LA Rams and football during the NFL season, but might also post analysis related to other interests like gaming and politics.

This site was made with the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
