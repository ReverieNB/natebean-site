I'm a Research Fellow at the University of Minnesota and created this site to use data analysis and R to explore some of my favorite topics. I plan to post about the LA Rams and football during the NFL season, but might also post analysis about other interests as well!

This site was made with the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
